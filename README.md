## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 for semantic markup
- CSS3 with Flexbox and grid for styling using Sass
- Using React's useState and createContext to share component properties.

### This project provided insights into:

In order to use context variables in box's tags like onChange in a button 
I'm not allowed to use it directly so it has to be written this way: onClick={() => setVariable(state)}

### Continued development
For future projects, I plan to:
Explore modern CSS features for more complex layouts.
